# Password-Manager
Secure and trustful Password Manager for all of your passwords

# How to work with this password manager
Enter your Login Password in originalPassword.txt file.This will be the password for
this Manager. Once you Login to the manager, you can add your sites and passwords.
I am still currently developing this project. As of now the passwords and the sites
are stored in the program memory. I will try to add a database soon.
